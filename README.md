# CS_340_Database_Website
This is the portfolio project for CS 340, which features a database driven website for a fictional movie business which serves as the database for their operations

CITATION NOTICE - 12/07/2023
All code is based on the CS 340 starter code, with the exception of the code to dynamically display drop downs, and the portion of the add movie query that also requires adding a genre input. Displaying dynamic drop-downs and user-friendly attributes in display tables, as well as the re-route if all Customers are deleted are entirely our own work
